# The desktop app's Settings -> Connections -> Add environment -> SSH flow does
# the same thing through the GUI, and cannot be scripted: the app keeps its
# environments in an encrypted connection-catalog.json and registers only a
# `t3code://app` deep link, with no pairing URL form.
#
# So this takes the other route T3 supports — run the server on the box and
# pair with it — and solves the reachability problem with an SSH tunnel. The
# server binds to loopback inside the container, so it is reachable ONLY
# through this tunnel: not from other containers on the bridge, and not from
# the LAN. (`t3 serve --host 0.0.0.0` would expose it to both.)
#
# Leaves the tunnel running in the background; re-running is safe.
